 @abstract The rate you want the view to redraw its contents.
 @discussion When your application sets its preferred frame rate, the view chooses a frame rate as close to that as possible based on the capabilities of the screen the view is displayed on. The actual frame rate chosen is usually a factor of the maximum refresh rate of the screen to provide a consistent frame rate. For example, if the maximum refresh rate of the screen is 60 frames per second, that is also the highest frame rate the view sets as the actual frame rate. However, if you ask for a lower frame rate, it might choose 30, 20, 15 or some other factor to be the actual frame rate. Your application should choose a frame rate that it can consistently maintain. The default value is 30 frames per second.

This value does not account for dropped frames, so it is not a measurement of your statistical frames per second. It is the static value for which updates should take place.
